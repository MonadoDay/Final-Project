      <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>My name is Reginald Fairley Jr. I am known as "Reggie" by most people but you can give me any nickname you want. I am currently getting myself involved in all kinds of entertainment classes including but not limited to "Media Computation, Digital Art, Music, Software development, and Animation". I am familiar with a lot of programs such as "Python, FL Studio, Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and Ibis Paint X". I am currently a freshman at CityTech and though I don't have a concentration yet, I am thinking of concentrating on Media Computation. I struggle with ADHD but that won't stop me from pursuing the skills I want to obtain. I plan on becoming a content creator soon(More details under "The Ultimate Goal"). Thank you for visiting my website</p>
      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Playing Games: Sports, Videogames, Card Games, and board games(mainly Chess)
        <p>Listing to music: Mainly Rock, Classical Music, EDM, and rap.
        <p>Storytelling: Give me anything and I can make a story out of it!
        <p>Reading: I mainly read novels and graphic novels. Recently I have gotten into two japanese entertainment known as manga and light novels
      <h2>The Ultimate Goal</h2>
        <p>I plan on using everything I learn at CityTech and my other online classes to create an entertainment company made of my allies where we produce comics, shows, and possibly games. I have been exposed to many forms of media throughout my life and I really believe I can make content that will interest lots of people. I've made early designs for characters for a possible web series that can be found under <a href="file:///C:/Users/rfair/OneDrive/Desktop/mtec1003/Final-Project/myportfolio.html">My Portfolio</a>. This goal is mainly for me to finally fulfill my dream of one day filming a movie. If I don't get that far I will already be satisfied with the skills I formed which I can use to make a decent living. I am currently looking for places to learn such skills to animate and draw and soon I will get started on my first series. Thank you for reading.</p>
